Welcome to my blog! This is my first post about physics and mathematics.

## Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

Let's start with the famous equation relating mass and energy, that is:

$$E = mc^2$$

Where:
- $E$ is energy
- $m$ is mass
- $c$ is the speed of light

What made him reach this equation? If it was not him, someone else would have come with some questions and would have answered them... alone or in the set of other scientists. The main topic, is more what pushes us as human being to look around and try to understand what and how our environment is made of. Also, this has started long time ago, our perception has changed to current most robust vision proposed by Einstein... until someone arrives and put a bigger question on the table to make us see the world even more accurately.

Today, I would like to dig more and try to give a feeling about this famous mass-energy equivalence.

## General Relativity

The Einstein field equations are:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$$

This is just the beginning of my journey into writing about physics!
