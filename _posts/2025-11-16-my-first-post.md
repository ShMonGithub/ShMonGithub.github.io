Welcome to my blog! This is my first post about physics and mathematics.

## Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

The famous equation relating mass and energy is:

$$E = mc^2$$

Where:
- $E$ is energy
- $m$ is mass
- $c$ is the speed of light

## General Relativity

The Einstein field equations are:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$$

This is just the beginning of my journey into writing about physics!
